## LibDriver SGP30

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/sgp30/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The SGP30 is a digital multi-pixel gas sensor designed for easy integration into air purifier, demand-controlled ventilation, and IoT applications. Sensirion’s CMOSens technology offers a complete sensor system on a single chip featuring a digital I2C interface, a temperature controlled micro hotplate, and two preprocessed indoor air quality signals. As the first metal-oxide gas sensor featuring multiple sensing elements on one chip, the SGP30 provides more detailed information about the air quality.The sensing element features an unmatched robustness against contaminating gases present in real-world applications enabling a unique long-term stability and low drift. The very small 2.45 x 2.45 x 0.9 mm3 DFN package enables applications in limited spaces. Sensirion’s state-of-the-art production process guarantees high reproducibility and reliability. Tape and reel packaging, together with suitability for standard SMD assembly processes make the SGP30 predestined for high-volume applications.

LibDriver SGP30 is a full-featured driver of SGP30 launched by LibDriver.It provides TVOC, CO2 eq reading, temperature and humidity correction and other functions.LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver SGP30 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver SGP30 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver SGP30 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver SGP30 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver SGP30 offline document.

/datasheet includes SGP30 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_sgp30_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
uint16_t co2_eq_ppm;
uint16_t tvoc_ppb;

res = sgp30_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    sgp30_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = sgp30_basic_read((uint16_t *)&co2_eq_ppm, (uint16_t *)&tvoc_ppb);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)sgp30_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    sgp30_interface_debug_print("sgp30: co2 eq is %d ppm.\n", co2_eq_ppm);
    sgp30_interface_debug_print("sgp30: tvoc is %d ppb.\n", tvoc_ppb);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)sgp30_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example advance

```C
#include "driver_sgp30_advance.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
uint16_t co2_eq_ppm;
uint16_t tvoc_ppb;
uint16_t id[3];
uint8_t product_type;
uint8_t product_version;

res = sgp30_advance_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

res = sgp30_advance_get_serial_id((uint16_t *)id);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)sgp30_advance_deinit();

    return 1;
}
sgp30_interface_debug_print("sgp30: serial id 0x%04X 0x%04X 0x%04X.\n", (uint16_t)(id[0]), (uint16_t)(id[1]), (uint16_t)(id[2]))

...

res = sgp30_advance_get_feature((uint8_t *)&product_type, (uint8_t *)&product_version);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)sgp30_advance_deinit();

    return 1;
}
sgp30_interface_debug_print("sgp30: product type is 0x%02X.\n", product_type);
sgp30_interface_debug_print("sgp30: product version is 0x%02X.\n", product_version);

...

res = sgp30_advance_set_iaq_baseline(0x01, 0x02);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)sgp30_advance_deinit();

    return 1;
}

...

res = sgp30_advance_set_absolute_humidity(25.6, 30.2f);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)sgp30_advance_deinit();

    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    sgp30_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = sgp30_advance_read((uint16_t *)&co2_eq_ppm, (uint16_t *)&tvoc_ppb);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)sgp30_advance_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    sgp30_interface_debug_print("sgp30: co2 eq is %d ppm.\n", co2_eq_ppm);
    sgp30_interface_debug_print("sgp30: tvoc is %d ppb.\n", tvoc_ppb);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)sgp30_advance_deinit();

return 0;
```
